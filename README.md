C++ chess engine

Just a simple bruteforce chess engine. Not really that strong although quite enough to defeat me. Uses bitboards as board representation, and minmax algorithm.
Note: there's no graphics to this, and never will be (just terminal). I will probably make another one (stronger hopefully) with custom graphical user interface.

To run, just copy the commands.txt into the terminal
